# simpleBlockchain
Make a Simple blockchain:
The information of the genesis block in JSON format is available. You can also download ten ledgers and ten
different puzzles from the above addresses. You should find a nonce value in each round to solve the puzzle for
each ledger and make the corresponding blocks. Eventually, you will compute a blockchain with 11 blocks.
• Your codes have to be written in python.
• Use SHA-256 for producing hash.
• Your program has to print the block number, block hash, the hash of the previous block, and the nonce value
in each round.
• Generating block 11 has extra points. In round 11, we have a more complicated computational math problem
(i.e., puzzle) that you can not find its hash on your laptop. You can use Google Colab to run your program
for solving this problem.
